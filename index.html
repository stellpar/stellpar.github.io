<h1>The Begin to Madness</h1>
<p>there is nothing interesting here</p>
<h2>What More?</h2>
<p>nothing more, ok</p>
<h2>Where Should I Go Now?</h2>
<p>away, to a better world, somewhere... provided below</p>
<p>My suggestions are NONE. Except for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://disroot.org">Disroot</a></li>
<li><a href="https://getmonero.org">Monero</a></li>
</ul>
<p> that's all, hosted on github pages because i don't have enough money for <s>narcotics</s> a domain and VPS.</p>
